Notes:

Containers: Kubernetes is designed to work with container technologies like Docker. Containers encapsulate an application and its dependencies, making it easy to deploy and run the application consistently 
across different environments.

Nodes: A Kubernetes cluster consists of one or more nodes. Nodes can be physical machines or virtual machines and serve as the runtime environment for containers.

Pods: The basic unit of deployment in Kubernetes is a pod. A pod can contain one or more containers that share the same network and storage resources. Pods are scheduled onto nodes by Kubernetes.

Deployment: Kubernetes provides deployment objects that manage the lifecycle of pods. Deployments allow you to define the desired state of your application, including the number of replicas, and Kubernetes 
ensures that the actual state matches the desired state.

Services: Kubernetes services provide networking capabilities to pods. They allow pods to communicate with each other and provide a stable endpoint for accessing the application.

Scaling: Kubernetes supports horizontal scaling, which means you can dynamically adjust the number of pod replicas based on resource utilization or other metrics. This helps in efficiently utilizing 
resources and handling changes in workload demand.

Self-healing: Kubernetes has built-in mechanisms for self-healing. If a pod or node fails, Kubernetes automatically restarts or reschedules the affected components to maintain the desired state.

Configurations: Kubernetes allows you to manage configurations using ConfigMaps and Secrets. ConfigMaps store configuration data as key-value pairs, while Secrets are used for sensitive information like 
passwords or API keys.

Resource Management: Kubernetes provides features for resource management, including resource quotas, limits, and requests. This helps in allocating resources efficiently among different applications running 
in the cluster.

Extensibility: Kubernetes is highly extensible and customizable. It has a rich ecosystem of plugins and extensions, such as Helm charts for package management, Istio for service mesh capabilities, and 
Prometheus for monitoring.

Namespaces: Kubernetes uses namespaces to organize and isolate resources within a cluster. They provide a way to partition cluster resources between multiple users or teams, helping in resource management 
and access control.

Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs): Kubernetes supports persistent storage for stateful applications through PVs and PVCs. PVs represent storage resources in the cluster, 
while PVCs are requests for persistent storage made by pods. This allows data to persist even if pods are restarted or rescheduled.

StatefulSets: For stateful applications that require stable and unique network identities, StatefulSets are used in Kubernetes. They provide guarantees for the ordering and uniqueness of pod identities, 
which is important for databases, message brokers, and other stateful workloads.

Rolling Updates and Rollbacks: Kubernetes supports rolling updates for deployments, allowing you to update your application without downtime by gradually replacing old pods with new ones. If a new version 
of the application introduces issues, Kubernetes also supports rollbacks to revert to a previous stable version.

Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and Operators: Kubernetes allows you to define custom resources and controllers using Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and Operators. This enables you to extend 
Kubernetes' capabilities and automate complex application management tasks.

Networking: Kubernetes provides a range of networking options, including Cluster Networking (for pod-to-pod communication within the cluster), Service Networking (for exposing services to the external world), 
and Network Policies (for implementing network access control and security policies).

Monitoring and Logging: Kubernetes integrates with various monitoring and logging tools to provide visibility into cluster performance, application health, and logs. Popular monitoring solutions include 
Prometheus, Grafana, and Elasticsearch with Kibana (ELK stack).

Security: Kubernetes offers several security features such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Pod Security Policies (PSPs), Network Policies, and Secrets Management. These features help in securing the 
cluster, controlling access to resources, and managing sensitive information securely.

Auto-scaling: In addition to manual scaling, Kubernetes supports auto-scaling based on metrics such as CPU utilization or custom metrics using Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscaler 
(VPA). This ensures that your applications can handle varying loads automatically.

Multi-cloud and Hybrid Deployments: Kubernetes is designed to be cloud-agnostic and supports multi-cloud and hybrid deployments. This allows you to run Kubernetes clusters across different cloud providers 
or on-premises infrastructure, providing flexibility and portability for your applications.
