Load Balancing: In high-traffic web applications, load balancing distributes incoming client requests across multiple servers to ensure optimal performance, scalability, and reliability.

Caching: Caching mechanisms like browser caching, server-side caching (e.g., using Redis or Memcached), and content delivery networks (CDNs) improve web app performance by storing and serving 
frequently accessed data/content more efficiently.

Security: Web application security is crucial and includes measures such as user authentication, authorization, data encryption, input validation, protection against common web 
vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL injection), and regular security audits/testing.

Service Models:

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides virtualized computing resources (e.g., virtual machines, storage, networking) on a pay-per-use basis. Users have control over operating systems, applications, 
and configurations.
Platform as a Service (PaaS): Offers a platform for developing, deploying, and managing applications without the complexity of managing underlying infrastructure. Examples include cloud-based databases, 
development platforms, and middleware.
Software as a Service (SaaS): Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users access applications through web browsers, with the provider handling maintenance, updates, and 
scalability.

Deployment Models:

Public Cloud: Resources are provided by third-party cloud providers and accessible over the internet. Examples include AWS (Amazon Web Services), Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
Private Cloud: Resources are dedicated to a single organization and hosted either on-premises or by a third-party provider. Offers more control, customization, and security.
Hybrid Cloud: Combines public and private cloud environments, allowing data and applications to move between them. Provides flexibility, scalability, and the ability to leverage both 
environments based on workload requirements.
