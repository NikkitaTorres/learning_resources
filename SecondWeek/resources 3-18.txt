Order of learning, order of thinking - Learning the overall picture before trying to "understand" concepts makes it easier to connect the dots between different subjects in materials.

* Hash - A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that takes an input (or "message") and produces a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hexadecimal number. 
Hashing is commonly used in data storage and authentication systems to map data of arbitrary size to a fixed-size value.

* Salt - Salt is random data that is added to a password before it is hashed. The purpose of using a salt is to defend against rainbow table attacks, where an attacker precomputes hash values for commonly 
used passwords. Salting makes each password hash unique, even if the passwords are the same.

* HMAC - (Hash-based Message Authentication Code): HMAC is a mechanism for verifying the authenticity and integrity of a message using a cryptographic hash function and a secret key. 
It involves hashing the message with the secret key, resulting in a unique hash value that can be used to verify the message's integrity.

* Symmetric Encryption - Symmetric encryption uses a single key to both encrypt and decrypt data. The same key is used by both the sender and the recipient to encode and decode the information. 
Common symmetric encryption algorithms include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and DES (Data Encryption Standard).

* Keypairs - In cryptography, a keypair consists of two related cryptographic keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is used for encryption and verifying signatures, while the private key is 
used for decryption and creating signatures. Key pairs are fundamental to asymmetric encryption systems.

* Asymmetric Encryption - Also known as public-key cryptography, asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys (public and private) to encrypt and decrypt data. The public key is freely distributed and used 
for encryption, while the private key is kept secret and used for decryption. RSA and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) are common asymmetric encryption algorithms.

* Signing - Signing is the process of applying a digital signature to a message or document using a private key. The signature is a unique identifier that verifies the authenticity and integrity of the 
message, as only the holder of the corresponding public key can verify the signature. Digital signatures are often used in secure communication and data validation processes.
